<!-- badges: end -->

The holiday season is around the corner and we are flooded with information for possible destinations. The goal is to create a Shiny app to extract useful information from differnt data sources to ultimately answer the question which holiday destination to choose.

We have pre-selected the following destinations:

- Crete
- Rome
- Vienna
- Lisbon
- Mallorca

We would now like to present information for each of these destinations using different information sources:

- AirBnB (for rooms, prices, ratings, etc.)
- Google Places (nearby restaurants, museums, maps)
- Statistics from OECD (PPP, Quality of living, demographics, etc.)
- Weather Data (forecasts and historical, temperature, rain)
- Twitter Data (analyzing Twitter stream for respective location, sentiment, important words, etc.)

Each team shall choose one information source and create a Shiny Dashboard page presenting useful information. The respective destination will serve as an input and can be changed interactively. 

Each team will work on one of the prepared modules:

- AirBnB: `R/mod_airbnb.R`
- Google Places: `R/mod_places.R`
- Statistics: `R/mod_statistics.R`
- Weather: `R/mod_weather.R`
- Twitter, NYTimes Data: `R/mod_news.R`

Data is already prepared with the workspace in the folder `~/workshop` and can be hard-coded within the application if used directly. Alternatively, data can also be integrated within the `/data` folder.

## Installation

You can install the released version of travelboard from
[Github](https://github.com/Quantargo/travelboard) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("travelboard")
```

You can run the app after package has been installed using

`travelboard::run_app()`

or within the directory `inst/app` by selecting either `server.R` or `ui.R` within RStudio and hitting the button **Run App**.

## Project Template

- Template has been created using **golem**
- Settings applied using `dev/01_start.R` and `dev/02_dev.R`
- Created five modules
- Called by `inst/app_server.R`
- Checkout the template from Github at https://github.com/Quantargo/travelboard
- Each team should only work on one module - additional functions can be added to the package, as well.
